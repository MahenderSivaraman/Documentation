An Array:
> An array is a collection of one or more values of a same type. 
> Each value in the array is called an Element
> Each element will share the same variable name but they have unique index number align to it.
> Data type of an array can be Int, Float, Char and many more. All the elements inside the array will have the same data type 
that is assigned to the array. 
> For example : EmpId[100] can be a arry. Where the first index value of the arry will EmpId[0] and last index value will be EmpId[99]
  > Empid -- is the array variable and 100 is the index or the subscript value.

Types of Array: [based on C]
> Array can be single or multidimentional. 
  > An array with one dimension is called a 1-D array
  > An array with two dimension is called a two dimension or 2-D array. 

One Dimension Array:
>Represents as a row where all the elements are stored one after another. 
  >Syntax : datatype array_name[size];
  >int age[100];
  >Float temp[20];
  >Char ch[50];
 >When an array is declared, it contains only garbage values. 
 
 Example : 
 Int my_arr[5];
 
 Int i=0, j=2;
 my_arr[i]; --> first element
 my_arr[i+1]; --> second element
 my_arr[i+j]; --> third element
 
 
 Two Dimensional array:
 >Similar to 1-D array, 2-D array use 2 subscripts instead of 1. 
   > Example : int arr[2][3];
 the above array can store 2*3 = 6 values/elements.
 
    0     1     2
 0  0,0   0,1   0,2
 1  1,0   1,1   1,2
 
  >Garbage value will be printed if attempted to print elements out of the array scope. For example arr[0,3]
 
Multidimension Array: 
> Can create array 3 or more dimensions. 
Example : int arr[2][3][2];
Total elements : 2*3*2 = 12
This is similar to 2 2-D arrays
