logn  -- slower growing than even linear functions
n  -- grow linearly with the input for n
nlogn -- faster growing than linear but slower than quadratic
n^2 -- grows faster than the linear log function
n^3 -- faster growing than quadartic but slow than exponential
2^n  -- faster than all of functions except n!
n! --- fastes of all metioned
