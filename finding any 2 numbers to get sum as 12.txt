•	program for finding any 2 numbers to get sum as 12 from array {1,3,5,7,9,4}

1) Sort the array in acsending order.
2) Initialize two index after sorting
       (a) Initialize first to the leftmost index: l = 0
       (b) Initialize second  the rightmost index:  r = ar_size-1
3) Loop while l < r.
       (a) If (A[l] + A[r] == sum of 12)  then return l and r as answers
       (b) Else if( A[l] + A[r] <  sum )  then l++
       (c) Else r--    
4. End
